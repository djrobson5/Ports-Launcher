> **Ports Launcher itself ships no game files, ROMs, ISOs, or any other copyrighted asset whatsoever.** Every catalog entry only ever installs the "recomp"/source-port *code* — an open-source build published by that project's own repository. Any entry that needs original game data says so explicitly in its **Required files** instructions, and expects you to supply it yourself from a copy of the game you already legally own; Ports Launcher never bundles, downloads, hosts, or links to that data anywhere. Using your own original, legally-obtained copy is entirely on you — Ports Launcher has no way to check where that file came from, and takes no responsibility for it.

A lightweight library/installer for native "recomp" and source-port builds of console games, for Windows: browse a catalog, install straight from a GitHub/GitLab release (or a direct download link), launch, and keep everything up to date from one window. Built with Rust and [Slint](https://slint.dev), with full keyboard *and* gamepad navigation throughout, and nothing to install separately (a minimal 7-Zip ships alongside the executable to extract port releases).

## Features

- Catalog-driven library (`ports.json`) — add a new port by editing one JSON file, no code changes needed
- **Your own local catalog** (`ports.local.json`) — add ports you manage yourself (no download source, you place the game files under `Library/` by hand) in a separate file that's never touched by a `ports.json` update, so your own additions always survive
- One-click install: downloads the right release asset for your architecture automatically (GitHub or GitLab releases, or a direct URL), extracts it, and unwraps a single top-level wrapper folder if the archive has one
- Auto-updates by default — pressing **Play** on an installed GitHub/GitLab port silently checks for a newer release first (based on the release tag *and* its publish/asset date, so a project that keeps recycling the same "latest" tag for every build is still caught) and installs it before launching. Turn it off per port from the Info panel's **Update** button if you'd rather stay pinned to a specific version
- Ports Launcher checks its own GitHub releases too: the **GitHub** button in the footer turns into **Update** when a newer build of the launcher itself is out. Clicking it runs `ports_launcher_updater.bat` (downloads the latest build, replaces the current files, and relaunches)
- **Check for Updates** switch in Settings — one master toggle to turn off every update check at once (the launcher's own, and every port's), for anyone who'd rather update everything by hand
- **Discord Rich Presence** switch in Settings (off by default) — shows the game you're playing on your Discord profile while it's running
- Playtime tracking — every port's cumulated play time and last-played date show up in its Info panel, with a **Reset Game Time** button if you want to start the counter over; the catalog itself lists your most recently played ports first
- Uninstall in one click, with your save data preserved if it lives inside the port's own folder; box art is downloaded once and cached locally afterward
- **Save Backup** button in Settings to export every port's saves into a dated folder in one click (see [Game Saves](#game-saves) for both mechanisms)
- Info panel per port: installed version/tag, setup instructions, and one-click links to the website, mods page, install folder, and save folder(s) — with fully selectable/copyable instructions text
- **Select version** button in the Info panel — pick from the last few GitHub/GitLab releases and install that one instead of always the latest, useful when the newest release drops a platform you need (e.g. a Windows build); also doubles as a way to force an update right away instead of waiting for the next Play
- **Install extras** button in the Info panel — for a port whose `ports.json` entry has an `extra` link, downloads that extra file or archive into the port's folder on demand (overwriting same-named files; an archive is unpacked, a loose file is dropped in as-is). Meant for optional add-ons that aren't part of the port's own releases — ready-made launch options or preset config files, often an arbitrary pick. Installing a port never pulls these in by itself
- Fullscreen "Library" mode (`Alt+Enter`) — every *installed* port as a grid of cards, Steam Big Picture style
- Full gamepad navigation (XInput) *and* full keyboard navigation (arrow keys, Enter, Escape) everywhere in the app, including every dialog — browse, install, launch, open info, pick a file/executable, and back out, with either a controller or just the keyboard
- Every dialog matches the main window's title bar, font, and sizing, and grows to fit its own content — a long message or a long filename is never cut off
- 100+ ready-made color themes, switchable live from the in-app Settings picker with instant preview
- Single-instance lock — relaunching just refocuses the existing window
- System tray icon — closing the main window sends it to the tray instead of quitting. Left-click the icon to bring it back; right-click for a menu with your 5 most recently played games (jumps straight to Play), **Settings**, and **Quit**. A dedicated minimize button sits in the title bar too, next to Settings
- **Force Update** in Settings — runs the launcher's own updater immediately instead of waiting for the next periodic check

## Keyboard shortcuts

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| Type | Fuzzy-filter the catalog live |
| `↑` / `↓` or `Ctrl+W` / `Ctrl+S` | Move selection up / down |
| `←` / `→` or `Ctrl+A` / `Ctrl+D` | Jump a page (10 rows, windowed list) / a column (Library grid) |
| `Enter` | Install the selected port if it isn't installed yet, launch it otherwise |
| `Shift+Enter` | Open the selected port's install folder in Explorer |
| `Alt+Enter` | Toggle fullscreen Library mode |
| `Ctrl+1`...`Ctrl+9` / `Ctrl+0` | Resize the windowed launcher to 10%...90% / 100% of screen size, windowed mode only |
| `Ctrl+-` / `Ctrl+=` | Shrink / grow the border by 1px, windowed mode only |
| `Escape` | Close the dialog on top if one is open, back out of Library mode if it's active, otherwise close the launcher |

The search box always keeps keyboard focus in the main window — every key above is intercepted there directly. Any dialog on top (Info, Settings, install progress, a file/executable picker...) gets its own keyboard focus instead: arrow keys — or the same `Ctrl+W`/`A`/`S`/`D` aliases — move the selection inside it, `Enter` activates it, `Escape` closes it (except the install-progress dialog, which can't be interrupted).

## Gamepad

Plug in an XInput controller (Xbox-style) and every window responds to it immediately, no setup needed — the same input router works on the main library and on every dialog on top of it. Moving the selection with the mouse and with the controller/keyboard always stays in sync — there's only ever one thing highlighted at a time, however you moved it there:

| Button | Action |
|---|---|
| D-pad / left stick | Move selection |
| `A` or `Start` | Install / Launch the selected port (same as `Enter`) |
| `B` | Back out of the current dialog |
| `X` | Open the Info panel for the selected port |
| `Back` | Toggle fullscreen Library mode |

## Library mode

`Alt+Enter` switches to a fullscreen grid of every port you currently have *installed* — like Steam's Big Picture library. Ports you haven't installed yet only show up in the windowed list view, never in Library mode. `Escape` (or `Alt+Enter` again) returns to the windowed view.

## Info panel

Select a port and open its **Info** panel (button, or `X` on a controller) for its installed version/tag, any setup instructions from `ports.json` (selectable, copy-pastable text), and one-click links to its website, mods page, install folder, and save folder — plus a **Save folder 2** button for ports with a second, independent save location (`save2`). Any of these is simply disabled if it doesn't exist yet (not installed, the game hasn't created a save yet, or the port has no second save location at all). `↑`/`↓` (or the controller D-pad/stick) scrolls the instructions text when it's too long to fit; `←`/`→` moves between the buttons, `Enter`/`A` activates whichever one is highlighted.

Next to the version text, a **Select version** button (GitHub/GitLab ports only) fetches the last few releases and lets you install any of them instead of always the latest — handy when the newest release doesn't have a build for your platform, or you just want to roll back. It also always fetches fresh from GitHub/GitLab, so picking the latest one from the list is a way to force an update right away; installing a specific version this way also turns off auto-update for that port, so it isn't silently swapped for the latest release on the next Play.

For an installed port, the row also shows **Auto-update: On/Off**, **Favorite executable**, **Last played**, and **Play time**, each with its own button right below the version/status text — turn auto-update off (and back on) per port, pick which executable Play launches directly without asking every time, or reset that port's tracked playtime. A port with auto-update turned off shows a crossed-out yellow **Update** button next to **Play** in the main list as a reminder that it won't update itself.

Next to those, an **Install extras** button is enabled only when the port's `ports.json` entry carries an `extra` link *and* the port is installed. **Play/Install only ever installs the game itself** — the extras are separate and always opt-in from here. Clicking it (after a confirmation prompt) downloads that file or archive straight into the port's folder, overwriting any file of the same name. An archive (`.zip`, `.7z`, `.tar.gz`, `.rar`) is unpacked into the folder; anything else — a loose `.exe`, a `.json`, a config file — is dropped in as-is, never unpacked. It's for optional add-ons that aren't part of the port's own releases: extra ways to play, or preset configuration files — which are often an arbitrary pick, so treat them as a convenience rather than a recommendation. If the link is dead or empty, nothing happens and nothing in the folder is touched.

## Game Saves

Ports Launcher handles two separate save mechanisms, both based on `ports.json`'s `save`/`save2` fields, kept in a `Saves Backup` folder next to the executable:

**Automatic preservation** (uninstall/reinstall) — uninstalling a port whose save lives inside the install folder copies it to `Saves Backup/Pending Restore/<folder>/save_folder/` (or `.../save_folder2/` for the second save location) a moment before the rest of the folder is deleted, then a later install of that same port moves it straight back into place and removes this temporary copy. A save that sits outside the install folder (e.g. under `%APPDATA%`) is never touched by an uninstall either way — it already survives on its own. `Pending Restore` is never a history: a single slot per port/field, overwritten on every uninstall — worth knowing about if you're digging through `Saves Backup/` by hand for a save that seems to have vanished mid-reinstall, or if an install gets interrupted and you need to recover it manually.

**Manual export** (**Save Backup** button, see [Settings](#settings) right below) — on demand, exports every port's saves across the whole catalog (installed or not, external or local) into a dated folder under `Saves Backup/Global Backups/<date>/<folder>/`, created fresh on every click without ever touching earlier dated folders — an actual history of snapshots, unlike `Pending Restore`.

## Settings

Open it from the **◯** button in the title bar — a menu with **Themes**, **Language**, **Files**, **Library**, **Save Backup**, **Check for Updates**, **Force Update**, and **Discord Rich Presence**.

- **Themes** and **Language** both open the same kind of live, fuzzy-searchable picker. For Themes, moving the selection (mouse hover, or `↑`/`↓`/the controller stick) previews it instantly across the whole app; confirming writes straight back to `themes.json`, and closing without confirming (`Escape`) reverts to whichever theme was active before. Language switches the UI immediately on selection, no restart needed.
- **Files** opens shortcuts to `ports.json`, `ports.local.json`, `state.json`, and `themes.json`, greyed out if a file doesn't exist yet.
- **Library** jumps straight to that folder in Explorer.
- **Save Backup** kicks off a full save export for the whole catalog into a dated folder (see [Game Saves](#game-saves) above), with a progress window while it copies.
- **Check for Updates** toggles On/Off right in the menu — turns every update check off at once (the launcher's own, and every installed port's at Play), for anyone who'd rather update everything by hand instead.
- **Force Update** runs the launcher's own updater right away, without checking first whether a newer build actually exists — for anyone who doesn't want to wait for the periodic check (or has it turned off above).
- **Discord Rich Presence** toggles On/Off right in the menu, off by default — shows the game you're playing on your Discord status while it's running, and clears itself the moment you close it.

## Useful tools

A couple of external tools come up repeatedly in `ports.json`'s **Required files** instructions, for preparing your own game data before pointing a port at it:

- **[7-Zip](https://github.com/ip7z/7zip)** — a minimal, command-line-only copy ships with Ports Launcher, but only to extract port release archives internally; get the regular graphical version separately to unpack a `.7z` (or other compressed) dump of a game you already own.
- **[extract-xiso](https://github.com/XboxDev/extract-xiso)** — not bundled, get it separately: pulls the individual files out of an Xbox/Xbox 360 `.iso`; several Xbox 360 ports' instructions explicitly ask for `extract-xiso.exe` to get their `assets` folder.

## Configuration

### `ports.json`

The main catalog, next to the executable — never bundled inside the `.exe`, so it (and the launcher itself) can be updated independently of any single port. Not meant to be hand-edited: it's replaced wholesale by catalog updates, so anything you add here yourself gets silently overwritten the next time it refreshes — see [`ports.local.json`](#portslocaljson) below to add your own ports permanently instead.

### `ports.local.json`

Your own catalog, next to `ports.json` — for ports you manage yourself rather than install through Ports Launcher: you create the folder under `Library/`, put the game's files there by hand, and it shows up exactly like any other port (playable, has an Info panel, shows up in Library mode once installed). Same entry format as `ports.json`, except `source` never applies here — omit it, or set it to nothing. Since this file lives separately, replacing `ports.json` with a newer version from the maintainer never touches what you've added here.

A `folder` that collides with one from `ports.json` replaces the official entry with your own local one. The **Uninstall** button also behaves differently for a local port: it never deletes anything — it opens the port's folder in Explorer instead, so you stay in full control of files Ports Launcher never downloaded in the first place.

The repo ships a `ports.local.json` with two disabled example entries (`"name"`/`"folder"` set to `null`, which makes Ports Launcher skip them) — copy one, fill in real values, and it becomes a real entry.

### `themes.json`

```json
{
  "themes": {
    "arc-dark": {
      "search_background": "#404552",
      "search_text": "#7c818c",
      "list_background": "#383c4a",
      "list_text": "#d3dae3",
      "selected_background": "#5294e2",
      "selected_text": "#ffffff",
      "border": "#4b5162"
    }
  }
}
```

Just the color palettes themselves; which one is active, and every other display preference, lives in `state.json` below instead (kept separate so a `themes.json` update from the maintainer, which replaces this file wholesale, never resets your own preferences). Switch themes live from the in-app picker (see [Settings](#settings) above).

### `state.json`

Internal bookkeeping (installed versions/playtime, window state, update-check timestamps) that Ports Launcher writes to on its own — you shouldn't need to touch it. Your display preferences live under its `"ui"` key: which theme is active, font family, the search placeholder text, whether the clock next to the search bar is shown, and the windowed-mode size/border — the same values also live-update and persist here via the in-app picker/`Ctrl+1`...`Ctrl+0`/`Ctrl+-`/`Ctrl+=` (see [Keyboard shortcuts](#keyboard-shortcuts)), so hand-editing them is only needed to change what the very first launch starts with.

`state.json` also doubles as the only way to raise the GitHub/GitLab unauthenticated API rate limit for update checks: add a `"github_token"`/`"gitlab_token"` key by hand (there's no in-app field for this yet). That token is then stored in **plain text**. Never share this file, upload it anywhere, or leave it visible on a stream/screen share — unlike `ports.json`/`themes.json`/`ports.local.json`, it can contain a credential.
